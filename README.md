There are currently two actual 'courses' uploaded. There is also a test course.

The first Titanfall course has a price, but the second one (the one with the ninja star in the thumbnail) is free.

It does currently require a sign in still. If I get time I'd like to have a guest be able to acess the free videos, but at the moment you need to sign up (fake email is fine) in order to view the course and its videos. I will update this README if that changes.
